# Term Project 2: Indexing

The project aims to speed up the implementation of the **Union, Minus, Project, Join, Type Check, and Select Relational Algebra operations** using **indexing techniques**. It builds upon the foundational concepts of relational algebra introduced in **Project 1**, enhancing the performance of operations through **BpTreeMap** or **B+Tree Indexing** in **Java 22**.

## Key Features

- **Objective:**  
  Speed up core **Relational Algebra Operations** using **indexing** in **Java** code.

- **Key Goals:**
  - Improve the efficiency of operations like **Union**, **Minus**, and **Join** using indexing techniques.
  - Implement and manipulate data using **Java tables** with **indices**, reinforcing the principles of table-based data operations.
  
- **Significance:**  
  Enhances the performance of relational algebra concepts such as **Union, Minus, Project, Join, Type Check**, and **Select** in a **Java** environment, optimizing operations by incorporating indexing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Java (Java 22).

## Technologies Used
- Java 22

## Execution

1. You can clone the project or download the Zip and extract it.
2. Open the project in any IDE with the root folder containing `src`, `pom.xml` files.
3. Use this command to compile: javac --enable-preview --release 22 *.java (If you do not have Java 22, change it to the version you have).
4. Use this command to run: java --enable-preview MovieDB
5. Run the project and check the application logs to ensure that the project is up and running successfully.


## Contribution

This project is a collaborative effort involving a team of 5 members, including a manager.

- Oscar implemented the optimized Join methods
- Shruti implemented the optimized Project method.
- Lauren implemented the optimized Select method. 
- Pranavi implemented the optimized Union and Minus methods
- Jacob implemented the BPTree
